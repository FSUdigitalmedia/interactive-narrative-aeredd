:: order

you scan the room for him, you do not see him 

you give your order to the lady at the counter

(TEXT BOX FOR COFFE ORDER)

as you are ordering you see your bestfriend run and jump into (nicknames) arms

they immediately go sit at a table, since he already has a coffee ready for her. 

        did they already forget you existed???
