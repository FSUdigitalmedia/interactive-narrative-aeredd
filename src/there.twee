:: there

you arrive

the only lights are your headlights

it appears to be this apartment like building, that hasn't been touched in years

you keep driving closer to it

    you see her car
    and <<print $loverboy>> 's

weird you think, it is 3 am and these building do not look like people could even live in them

[[you get out of your car|out]]
