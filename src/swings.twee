:: swings

they stumble into the apartment 

so drunk they don't even see you standing next to the door

without even thinking, you grab the knife out of your pocket that you left from slashing the tires 

and quickly stab it into <<print $loverboy>>'s back 

and without even time for <<print $name>> to react 
>>you stab her into the back as well

both screaming for help, you keep puncturing the knife within them 

[[until they are silent|silent]]
