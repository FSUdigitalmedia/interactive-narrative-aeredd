(best friend) walks outside

YOU PSYCHOPATH, she screams
I'M NEVER TALKING TO YOU again

    you look at yourself in the reflection of the window... 
    who are you
    what did you just do

before you can say anything, (loverboy) pulls up and (bestfriend) hops in his car

[[you head back inside|inside]]
